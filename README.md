# math-lm
Centralized repository for the Math-LM project, an open-source replication of the
[Minerva](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14858) model. 

This project contains the following directories
- `proof-pile-v2`: scripts for downloading and preprocessing data. 
- `task-finetunes`: scripts for fine-tuning models on task-specific datasets, such as MATH or GSM8k. 

In addition, this project makes contributions to
[EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness), such as [PR376](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/pull/376).
