"""
The idea of this script is to extract text from html while ensuring that mathematical content is
given in a mostly consistent way. The problem is that the internet has an inconsistently observed standard for
representing mathematical expressions.
For popular sites like wikipedia, planet-math and math-overflow, it's going to be better to extract the mathematical content directly from their API.
The hope is that this script will work for other sites.

There are 3 types of mathematical expressions that we support.
In all cases, if there is mathematical content, it should be returned between dollars (ideally double-dollars if it's block math)
and represented as LaTeX. There are also going to be problems with macros, but let's keep it simple for now.

## MathOverflow

Has the form
```
<span class="math-container">${latex content}$</span>
```

## PlanetMath

Uses mathml:

```
<math ... alttext="{latex content}">...</math>
```

## Wikipedia

Also uses mathml, but makes use of the `semantics > annotation`.

```
<math ... alttext="{latex content}">...
    <semantics> ...

        <annotation encoding="application/x-tex">{latex content}</annotation>
    </semantics>
</math>
```

Wikipedia also uses spans

```
The case <span class="texhtml"><i>a</i> = âˆ’1</span> leads to ...
```

These spans can contain unicode too, so they are not always valid LaTeX, so I think it's best to keep them
as text (`"The case a = -1 leads to ..."`) rather than trying to convert to valid latex.

So the procedure for extracting math text from math  is:
- Look for an element matching `math annotation[encoding="application/x-tex"]`, use that.
- Otherwise, look at the `alttext` attribute of the `math` tag.

We also need to figure out whether these math elements are block or inline.
This is done by inspecting the `display` attribute on the `math` element.

Unfortunately, wikipedia doesn't use this convention, instead display style is implicit from document structure and ad-hoc CSS.
The latex content is wrapped in a `{\displaystyle}` latex tag, so I think the right thing to do is just return
the latex content with this extra tag forcing display style.

In the MathOverflow case, we need only look for dollar signs.
I think this will cover most cases involving mathjax or katex, which are scanning for these dollars.
In this case we can behave the same as `get_text`.
